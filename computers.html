        <h2>The Commodore C64</h2>
        <p>When I first bought my C64 it was mainly for playing games. It was much cheaper than having to spend money in arcade halls to play my favourite games.</p><img src='images/c64.png' width='75' alt='commodore c64'/>

        <h2>The Commodore Amiga</h2>
        <p>After the C64 came a whole range of Commodore Amiga's which I learned to program in basic, assembler and C. Starting with the A500 I eventually owned an Amiga 1200, an Amiga 600 and the top range model the Amiga 4000.</p><img src='images/amiga.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
